# Javascript

This project was tasked as part of the _Nology coding course. The aim was to create a fully functioning calculator that relied purely javascript to complete calculations. I needed to apply the knowledge learnt in javascript the previous week, as well or direct a lot of self learning in order to complete the project. In the brief we were told to avoid using the eval( ) method and encouraged to find our own solutions to carry out the operations.

Using pseudocode I started breaking down each individual property the calculator required, beginning with making numbers appear on the display screen when the corresponding number was clicked, then moving on to formatting the equation process. This was my first project in Javascript and I learnt a lot about working with HTML, CSS and Javascript in the process.
